# Code
Matlab codes for the supervised and unsupervised learning of a Generalized Tikhonov regularizer for linear inverse problems. This set of codes deals with one-dimensional signals.
The file main.m can be modified by the user and is the core of the package. It allows the user to specify the main parameters and the statistical model, then runs the simulations and creates the related figures.
